Cross Compile Bootloader for NUC710

1. For the NUC710 from Nuton must use ADS to compile it, so we must install ADS1.2 first;

2. Compile Bootloader  
1)  Running ADS and choose "CodeWarrior for ARM Developer Suite" in "Tools" menu;
    Choose "File"->"Open", and open "buildAll\BuildAll.mcp" in the source codeode;
2)  After use ADS open BuildAll.mcp, Press "CTRL" and "-" Key to clean the last compiled object files;
    then press "F7" key to start compile it;
4)  After cross compile, we can get these image files£º init.bin, init.axf, updater.bin, updater.axf, bootloader.bin; 
    
    If we wanna use AXD to debug and burn bootloader, we will use init.axf and updater.axf image;
    If we wanna update bootloader when bootloader running, then we can excute updater.bin file in bootloader;
    If we wanna use H-JTAG to burn the bootloader, we should use bootloader.bin file.
    
    Further more, the file cpaxf.cmd script used to copye these images to source code top path;
